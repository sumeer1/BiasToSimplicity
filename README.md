# BiasToSimplicity

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for generating integration data, analyzing this data, and producing frequency versus complexity plots for the Tyson 1991 model in systems biology. The scripts automate the process of integrating both standard and perturbed models, followed by a detailed analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:
- MATLAB R2022b or later installed on your system.
- Access to MATLAB's command line interface for executing scripts.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   *git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git

   
2. **Set Up MATLAB Environment**
Run the `setup.m` script to add necessary folders to your MATLAB path. This step ensures that all functions and scripts are accessible to MATLAB.

Open MATLAB and run:
```matlab
run('setup.m')
```

## Usage

To generate and analyze data, follow these steps:

Run the Main Script
You can execute the main script directly from MATLAB's command line interface:
```
matlab -batch "Tyson1991"
```
